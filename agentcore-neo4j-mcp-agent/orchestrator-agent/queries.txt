# Neo4j Aviation Database - Multi-Agent Routing Test Queries
# These queries test routing to Maintenance and Operations specialist agents.
#
# Query Categories:
# - Maintenance Domain (1-10): Faults, components, sensors, reliability
# - Operations Domain (11-20): Flights, delays, routes, airports
#
# Each query should route to the appropriate specialist agent.

# === Maintenance Domain (Routes to Maintenance Agent) ===
