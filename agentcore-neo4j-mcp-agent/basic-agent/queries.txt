# Neo4j Aviation Database - Natural Language Queries
# These queries are designed for the aircraft fleet operations and maintenance database
# containing Aircraft, Flights, Airports, Systems, Components, Sensors, Readings,
# Delays, and Maintenance Events.
#
# Query Categories:
# - Basic Discovery (1-4)
# - Fleet Operations (5-8)
# - Maintenance & Reliability (9-13)
# - Flight Operations & Delays (14-17)
# - Advanced Analytics (18-20)

# === Basic Discovery ===

1. What is the database schema? Show me all node types and their relationships.

2. How many aircraft are in the fleet and what models do we have?

3. List all airports in the database with their IATA codes and cities.

4. Which manufacturers build the aircraft in our fleet and how many of each?

# === Fleet Operations ===

5. What aircraft does SkyWays operate and what are their tail numbers?

6. Show me all the systems installed on Boeing 737-800 aircraft.

7. What sensors are monitoring engine systems across the fleet and what do they measure?

8. Find all flights departing from JFK airport and show where they go.

# === Maintenance & Reliability ===

9. What are the most common maintenance faults across all aircraft?

10. Show me all critical severity maintenance events and which aircraft they affected.

11. Which components have the most maintenance events? Are there any patterns by component type?

12. Find aircraft with hydraulic system issues - show the faults and corrective actions taken.

13. What maintenance events have affected the CFM56-7B engines? Show severity and fault details.

# === Flight Operations & Delays ===

14. What are the most common causes of flight delays and how many minutes do they add on average?

15. Which routes have the most delays? Show the origin, destination, and total delay minutes.

16. Compare delay statistics by operator - which airline has the worst on-time performance?

17. Find all weather-related delays longer than 60 minutes and show the affected flights.

# === Advanced Analytics ===

18. For ExampleAir's Boeing 737-800 fleet, trace the path from aircraft to systems to components to sensors and show the full hierarchy.

19. Which aircraft have both maintenance events AND flight delays? Show the correlation between maintenance issues and operational delays.

20. Analyze sensor readings for engine temperature (EGT) sensors - what is the range of values and which sensors show the highest readings?
